                <br>
                <p>The definition of rest is to cease work or movement in order to relax, refresh oneself, or recover strength. Whether you are taking a moment to close your eyes and put your feet up or take a much-needed vacation, taking the time to rest has many benefits for your health and well-being.</p>

                <p>With so many of us working long hours to keep up with an ever-growing workload, and risking burnout just to keep up, the importance of rest is easily forgotten. Rest isn’t about being lazy or avoiding work. It’s necessary for our health and for being at our best when we are working.</p>

                <p>Rest has been shown to improve cardiovascular health, and lower blood pressure and cortisol levels. Vacation in particular has also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, and increase lifespan.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Here are some of the specific benefits of rest and relaxation:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>~ Restores your energy: </strong>You need to recharge your batteries in order to perform at peak effectiveness throughout the day. Rest and relaxation is part of your work cycle and taking advantage of it whenever possible will improve your productivity.</p>

                <p><strong>~ Repairs your body: </strong>Our bodies repair themselves from daily wear and tear when we rest. Rest and relaxation reduce stress and improves overall health. You’ll be able to easily work a full day.</p>

                <p><strong>~ Improves your focus: </strong>An active mind gets tired just like an active body. Including time to quiet your thoughts and letting your mind rest is part of the healing process. You’ll improve your ability to concentrate and problem solve at work.</p>

                <p><strong>~ Improves your mood: </strong>Relaxation makes you feel happier. When you choose to think about things that make you feel good, you’ll discover that you actually feel more positive about the challenges you face at work. You’ll begin to see obstacles as opportunities.</p>

                <p><strong>~ Increases your creativity: </strong>Too much stress and activity often disconnect you from your creative potential. Rest and relaxation will allow you to regenerate as an individual and as a team. Your ability to create and innovate as a team member and as a cohesive group will be improved when you return to work.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Here are a few ways to add rest into your life:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>•	Take a time-out. </strong>Take a time-out and remove yourself from a stressful situation. This can provide both a physical and mental break. It may be helpful to do some breathing exercises or mindful meditation to connect with your emotions, thoughts and body. Taking a time-out can be done by putting down your cellphone, closing your laptop and sitting outside for a few minutes. It can also include some other forms of self-care such as taking a bubble bath or getting a massage.</p>

                <p><strong>•	Take a nap. </strong>Taking a 20-30-minute nap during the day can increase productivity and alertness. If you are feeling groggy taking the time to shut your brain off can leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated afterward. If you are feeling sleepy in the middle of the workday, it may be more beneficial to shut your eyes instead of reaching for another cup of coffee. Even if it’s not possible to take a 30-minutes nap, taking 10 minutes to shut your eyes can leave you feeling much more awake.</p>

                <p><strong>•	Go on vacation. </strong>Research has found that going on vacation can reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease. Rather than getting on a plane to travel to another city during the pandemic use paid vacation time to take a staycation and give your mind and body a refresher. While enjoying your staycation schedule automatic email replies so you can truly disconnect.</p>

                <p><strong>•	Plan your rest day. </strong>Plan out a day specifically for rest. Mark your calendar for a day to say "no" to anything that comes up and may interfere with this day. Choose activities that encourage creativity while ignoring the news and your email. If possible, avoid doing things around the home and try planning meals in advance so you don’t have to worry about cooking. Take time to watch a movie you love or start a book you’ve been wanting to read. Do what feels good on your rest day so you feel refreshed when you get back to your busy life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Rabbi Elijah of Vilna once said, “What we create becomes meaningful to us only once we stop creating it and start to think about why we did so.” The implication is clear. We could live lives that produce countless widgets, but we won’t start truly living until we stop producing and start enjoying.</p>

                <h3>Capture the lost practice of taking rest and start living again.</h3>
