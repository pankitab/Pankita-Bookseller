                <br>
                <p><strong>What is a Mindset?</strong></p>

                <p>Your mindset is a collection of thought patterns and beliefs that shape your view of reality. It’s a story that you tell yourself about your identity and about the world around you. 𝑴𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒔𝒆𝒕 is a person’s usual attitude or mental state and plays a critical role in how you cope with life’s challenges, it can affect the way you live your life, see the world, and make decisions.</p>

                <p>Your mindset works as a foundation for your experiences in this world. The same events can happen to different people, and everyone will react differently – based on the mindset they hold. The exciting thing about the mindset is that it can be changed. You can challenge and replace your underlying assumptions about life. You don’t have to stay stuck where you are now.</p>

                <p>Your mindset can be your shield, your unbreakable armor that makes your spirit strong and lets it soar, or it can be the sword you fall on. And the best part is – the choice is yours. </p>

                <p>When you take responsibility for your life, you can recover from trauma and stress and move past it. When you understand your mindset and challenge your thoughts, you liberate yourself from being controlled by what you think. You realize that your thoughts are just thoughts: they don’t determine what is, you do.</p>

                <p><strong>How does Positive Mindset keep us Healthy</strong></p>

                <p>One of the most important key aspect or rather a very first step towards a healthy living is to have a Healthy Mind. People often look at “healthy living” as a sacrifice they need to make in their life instead of identifying the light that shines within, making them feel good and positive daily.</p>

                <p>Although a PERFECT plan can be developed to transform your health and boost your energy, it won’t be sustainable if you don’t ensure the correct mindset that is prioritizing your health.</p>

                <p>We all love eating good food, who doesn’t, right? But as we know , however fancy as the preps may look or as delicious as they may be, they get digested once they enter into our system and the body needs to throw the unwanted waste out in a days’ time failing to which may cause illness.</p>

                <p>Similarly, there is nothing in the world that can quench our thirst more and make us feel more refreshed than water. Yet if the body doesn’t throw that water out in a couple of hours, that retained water can be the cause of illness.</p>

                <p>Even, the air that we breathe in…… if we try to hold in for more than a few minutes and if we don’t breathe out, we all know the consequences.</p>

                <p>Isn’t this same principle true for our negative emotions as well? Emotional hurt, grudges, jealousy, feeling of hatred, revenge, anger…. All this makes our mind toxic. Yet we continue to hold them in our systems which leads to so many psychological and physical disorders.</p>

                <p>Just as food, water or air retained in the body can become toxic and cause physical ailments, negativity retained in the mind can cause mental disorders. Body has system to remove unwanted food, water or air without us even being aware of it. But that’s not how it works with the mind. We have to consciously work on purging these toxic emotions out of our inner systems.</p>

                <p>When you close the door of your mind to negative thoughts, the door of opportunity opens to you. We have the power to change negative thoughts and feelings into positive, rational, motivating thoughts, and in doing so, help create a healthy mind in a healthy body.</p>

                <p>By changing our minds, we really can change our lives. Remember to Detoxify your mind as Having a Healthy Mind is just as important as a Healthy Body.</p>

                <h3>Our life is what our thoughts make it.</h3>
