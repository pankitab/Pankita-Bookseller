          <h1>Welcome To My World</h1>
          <br>
          <p>From as early as I could remember, I had always been an emotional and highly sensitive individual. I vividly remember having a love and strong fascination for drawing with pencils. What fascinated me most about pencils was that with single shades of lead, I could create tones and textures so defined and so abstract, an illusion of color would be formed before me. I am a self-taught artist. In the process of putting pencil to paper, I find happiness in exploring the world around through them.</p>
          <br>
          <p>For a long time, I had left to devote to other things, but then returned again after years to explore myself again in the field of creativity. This very same passion led me towards exploring my talent in the field of front-end web development. I design and code beautifully, and I love what I do. I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions. I like to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Recently, I started my own personal journey by changing my habits and attaining a life that I knew I could maintain not only for myself, but for my family too. I developed a plan that has transitioned me to make better food choices while maintaining portion control that is incorporated with exercise that is maintainable by adding in small changes to my daily routine. I became a happier, healthier, motivated, and energetic new person that I never knew was there until I developed this wellness program. I am enjoying my life to the fullest and now as a mentor, I want to share my successful path with others so they can achieve weight loss by simple life changes that last a lifetime.</p>

          <br>
          <p>The right path is the one you make yourself that leads to your version of happiness. Happiness is not something readymade. It comes from your own actions. To embrace our unique passions and enjoy our own forms of fulfillment, we must be willing to step off the prescribed path and forge our own. No matter what your goals are, there’s always more than one way to realize them. Find yours. </p>

          <br>
          <p>You need to associate with people that inspire you, people that challenge you to rise higher, people that make you better. Your inspiration is what makes you who you are – what makes you discover and reach out to hit your goals. So make sure your time is spent with those who have the same aspirations. Surrounding yourself with positive people changes everything. </p>

          <h3 class="featured">"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston Churchill</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Whether success or failure, I want satisfaction of knowing my results are my own. Failure is a lesson learned and success is a lesson applied. It is my CHOICE that will determine my destiny. Taking pride in one’s craft and working hard for one’s own rewards is the opportunity of a lifetime. No one can live your life for you. You are in charge. Failures and missteps will happen along the way. That’s natural. When they occur, get up, learn from them, and move forward.</p>
