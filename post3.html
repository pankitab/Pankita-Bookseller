                <h1 class="post-title">Why Do Our Health Program Need Supplements??</h1>
                <br>
                <p>One of the most common questions we get from people who are on the fence about starting PH@TT program is Why does my body need supplements when I can get all the vitamins and nutrients needed through my food?</p>

                <p>The answer is simple, but scary. Our diet has become so poor that who are overweight are now malnourished. You’re probably thinking it’s hard for those two to co-exist, but the truth is the more processed food you eat, the more vitamins you need.</p>

                <p>We all live in our imaginary perfect world and according to us: we get plenty of sleep, we adequately stay hydrated, and we eat all our fruits and vegetables. But we don’t realize that what we intake is not enough because of many external & internal factors.</p>

                <p>Processed foods, stuffed with high fructose corn syrup, refined flours, and trans fats–are a daily occurrence in most households. Because they are convenient and inexpensive, they often take the place of more nutrient-dense foods. Also, now a days, modern agriculture is focused on producing crops maximized not for nutrition, but for size, fast growth rate and resistance to pests. Sadly, this leads to the soil becoming stripped of valuable nutrients, with each crop containing less vitamins and minerals than the one before.</p>

                <p>As the food we eat today contains fewer nutrients, the servings we consume, don’t deliver as much nutrition as they once did. Fewer nutrients mean lowered immunity and increased vulnerability to chronic disease and obesity.</p>

                <p>I have 8 powerful reasons that will help you to understand the real need to take dietary supplements, no matter how healthy your lifestyle may be:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  1. Our food source isn’t as whole as it once was, farming is not same, neither is the soil and our daily requirement for fruits and veggies has doubled in the past 15yrs.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  2. Supplements are a natural way of boosting your immune system and a cost effective way of keeping yourself healthy.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  3. Supplementation helps to transport and feed your muscles. It also helps to counter any minor or major deficiencies you may have. A common one being Vitamin D due to lack of sunlight and overuse of sunscreen.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  4. They keep your body and hormones balanced. Supplementation provides anti-oxidants (like vitamins A,C and E) that we can’t get 100% from food.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  5. Most medications and everyday stress depletes essential nutrients and in this age of pharmaceutical drugs, supplements help to restore balance.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  6. Supplementation may aid in preventing some health issues like high cholesterol.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  7. Supplements are generally in a form that is easy for your body to absorb and utilize. They help with oxidative stress.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  8. Supplementation, diet and exercise are the fountain of youth.
                </p>

                <p>The supplements we use in our program are absolute top quality and help bridge the gap between the foods we eat and nutritional deficiencies, giving yourself the best chance of good health. It’s the modified calorie meal plan that makes you lose the weight with the help from the products, like - <br>
                - one that is a thermogenic which helps break down the fat stores & give you energy,<br>
                - another gives you all the minerals & trace elements that your body doesn’t produce but needs to absorb the nutrients and vitamins,<br>
                - another helps to break down & digest your food,<br>
                - there’s even one that helps level out your hormones & curb your sugar & carb cravings...
                </p>

                <p>It’s imperative to have the supplements while doing a program of modified calories because you need to support your body properly through the process with the level of nutrition that they provide, so you don’t cause long term damage & nutritional deficiencies. This program works fast & successfully because of how it’s been designed. The awesome results you achieve are because the incredible nutrition works so well with our Alkaline meal plan.</p>
