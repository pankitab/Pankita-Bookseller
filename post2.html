                <h1 class="post-title">Why You Feel Bloated??</h1>
                <br>
                <p>0-30% of healthy individuals when asked reported that they regularly felt bloated. Feeling like you have a food baby worthy of a Christmas lunch can really kill your vibe. Even more frustrating is that the causes of bloating are
                  often tricky to pinpoint.</p>

                <p>Bloating tends to be described as a “stuffed” feeling and in some cases can cause pain and discomfort. It usually occurs when air enters the GI system and is unable to escape from above or below. In general, when you experience
                  bloating, it’s likely to be triggered by your body’s reaction to one or more of the following: food volume, gas, and/or stool.</p>

                <p>Bloating can increase as the day goes on, happen temporarily after a meal or at random times of the day, but the good news is that it tends to reduce overnight. Regardless of the cause, who wants to feel like they’re bursting out
                  of their pants for the rest of the day?</p>

                <p>Here are our tips and tricks to reduce bloating; </p>

                <h3>1. Watch your portion sizes</h3>

                <p>If you’re eating big meals and tend to feel uncomfortable afterward, then try smaller portions. This doesn’t necessarily mean less food, simply break your 3 big meals down into 4-5 smaller ones. The trick is to stop eating before
                  you are full. </p>

                <h3>2. Be aware of how foods affect your body</h3>

                <p>Food hypersensitivity is relatively prevalent. When you eat foods that you are hypersensitive to, it can cause excess gas production, bloating and other symptoms. The most common intolerances that cause bloating include; diary,
                  gluten,, FODMAPs, sugar alcohols and fructose.</p>

                <h3>3. Avoid foods with lots of sodium</h3>

                <p>Hands off that shaker, as experts cite salt as being one of the most common causes of bloat. When you eat too much of it — which most of us do — it causes fluid buildup that increases your blood volume, makes your heart work
                  harder, and gives you a distended stomach. To cut back on your intake, check the percentage of salt on the nutrition label; any more than 20 percent per serving means you’ve gone overboard.</p>

                <h3>4. Drink more water</h3>

                <p>This can literally be on every list, ever – drinking more water helps with almost everything. In terms of bloating, drinking water throughout the day can prevent constipation, which contributes to bloat.</p>

                <h3>5. Try our Digestive Enzymes</h3>

                <p>Our Digestive Enzymes contains six different enzymes to break down fats, proteins, and fibrous foods in your system. Protease, amylase, lactase, lipase, and cellulase are found naturally in the body, while bromelain is a
                  plant-derived enzyme that assist your body’s enzymatic process. Combined, these enzymes = healthier digestion, less bloating, wind, heartburn and reflux. Now that’s flattering!</p>
                <br>
                <p>To find lasting relief, determining the underlying cause and targeting the root of the problem is the answer. We need to find out what’s going on in our individual gut microbiomes so we can take the next steps to better our gut health – and hopefully find relief for our troublesome tummies.</p>
