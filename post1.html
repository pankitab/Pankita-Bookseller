                <h1 class="post-title">Why Is Gut Health Important for Your Body and Your Mind??? </h1>
                <br>
                <p>Your gut is home to more than 100 trillion bacteria. Yep! You read that right! But wait, this isn’t a bad thing. The bacteria play a vital role in your health by helping control digestion and benefiting your immune system and many other aspects of health.. The bacteria feed on dietary fiber while they perform a variety of duties, including helping to make vitamins B and K, and breaking down dietary fiber. This breakdown results in a release of beneficial, anti-inflammatory fatty acids that are vital energy sources for our bodies. An imbalance of unhealthy and healthy microbes in the intestines may contribute to weight gain, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and other disorders. The gut microbiome may also affect brain health by producing brain chemicals and communicating with nerves that connect to the brain.</p>

                <p>Most of the time when your immune system is weak, it can be traced back to what is happening in your gut. Just knowing that allows you to change what you are putting in your body so you can enhance your immune health. For optimal immunity, detoxification and nourishment, your gut must be in balance. It’s that simple.</p>

                <p><strong>Your gut is your second brain.</strong></p>

                <p>Did you know that STRESS is one of the biggest culprits behind digestives issues??? </p>

                <p>Gut bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining immunity, metabolic equilibrium and protecting against disease causing microorganisms. Researchers have also discovered that a nervous system in your gut (known as the “second brain”)
                  communicates with the brain in your head. It also plays a role in certain diseases and in mental health. That’s right many of our stomach problems are caused by our lifestyles. It’s never easy to own up to causing your body to feel
                  unwell and it’s not terribly easy to change those patterns, but we can…and we must! </p>

                <p>The gut and brain are connected physically through millions of nerves, most importantly the vagus nerve. This nerve sends signals in both directions between gut and brain. The gut and its microbes also control inflammation and make
                  many different compounds that can affect brain health. Gut bacteria affects brain health, so changing your gut bacteria may improve your brain health.</p>

                <p>This can be achieved by: Probiotics & Prebiotics</p>

                <p>What are Probiotics? They are live bacteria that impact health benefits when eaten. Probiotics that effect the brain are also called psychobiotics. Both probiotics and prebiotics have been shown to improve brain health. A number of
                  healthy foods such as fish particularly oily fish like salmon or tuna, foods high in fiber such as vegetables and fruits may help increase the beneficial bacteria in your gut and improve brain health.</p>

                <p>So basically your gut health and what you eat will effect your brain health and how you feel!</p>
